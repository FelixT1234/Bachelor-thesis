Computing background
 -> non-cold dark matter species with i=1 has m_i = 6.000000e-02 eV (so m_i / omega_i =9.400753e+01 eV)
 -> ncdm species i=1 sampled with 11 (resp. 5) points for purpose of background (resp. perturbation) integration. In the relativistic limit it gives Delta N_eff = 0.999997
 -> age = 13.797512 Gyr
 -> conformal age = 14150.207024 Mpc
 -> N_eff = 3.044 (summed over all species that are non-relativistic at early times)
 -> radiation/matter equality at z = 3404.338930

 -> sigma8=0.811533 for total matter (computed till k = 8.53373 h/Mpc)

Computing non-linear matter power spectrum with Halofit (including update Takahashi et al. 2012 and Bird 2014)
 -> [WARNING:] Non-linear corrections could not be computed at redshift z= 3.19 and higher.
    This is because k_max is too small for the algorithm (Halofit or HMcode) to be able to compute the scale k_NL at this redshift.
    If non-linear corrections at such high redshift really matter for you,
    just try to increase the precision parameter nonlinear_min_k_max (currently at 5.000000e+00) until k_NL can be computed at the desired z.
