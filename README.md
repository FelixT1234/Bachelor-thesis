The provided code files are the ones used in my bachelorÂ´s thesis: "Investigating Cosmological Models: The Impact of Parameter Variations on the Predicted Universe". With each program, either data or a plot is created, that can be seen in the thesis.

All code not commented out produces data or plots of the benchmark model. Commented code can be implemented again to test the impact of changes to the benchmark model, as done in the thesis.

The simulated CMB data (class-output) is produced by "The Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS)". http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2011/07/034.

The measured Planck values are from the Planck Legacy Archive: https://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology.
